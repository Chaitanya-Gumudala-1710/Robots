## Mobile manipulator
### Features

- **Dual Arms on a Cart:** The robot features two manipulator arms mounted on a mobile cart, providing versatility in handling various objects to tansport items from one place to.

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Utilizing advanced navigation algorithms, the robot autonomously moves by avoiding obstacles and optimizing its path for efficient completion for the task.

- **Object Recognition and Grasping:** Equipped with computer vision capabilities, the robot can recognize and grasp a wide range of items, making it adept at helping pick and place items.
